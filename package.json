  "description": "Spectator supports ES2015+ by transpiling files with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Any JavaScript feature included in the [latest preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/) can be used in a self assessment. The tradeoff for this support is that error messages can sometimes be a bit more obscure and/or line numbers in the stack trace don't map precisely to their original line numbers.",
